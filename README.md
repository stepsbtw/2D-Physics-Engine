# 2D Physics Engine

This project is a 2D Physics Engine that simulates various physical behaviors using basic physics principles.

The engine should be capable of handling multiple 2D objects and simulating interactions such as collisions, gravity, and other forces.

## Features

- **Collision Detection**: Accurate detection of collisions between objects.
- **Gravity Simulation**: Realistic gravity effects on objects.
- **Custom Forces**: Apply custom forces to simulate different scenarios.
- **Extendable**: Easily add new types of entities and interactions.
